leftDoubleImage,Ksawery Kirklewski,"Creative Coder and New Media Artist, Poland","Ksawery Kirklewski, born in 1988, creative coding and new media artist. Author of interactive light installations, music videos, generative animations, phygital sculptures, and realizations in public space. In his activities, he uses new technologies, programming and advertising media, focusing mostly on the digital and generative art field. During the process of Hunt 'N Gather, I found myself particularly drawn to his work 'Synphony in Acid,' a typographic music video for 'Symphony in Acid' ('Unspoken Words') by Max Cooper, built as a generative and interactive website symphonyinacid.net and recorded afterwards. It features text from 'Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus' (1921) by Ludwig Wittgenstein, dealing with limits of language. Max suggested using discourses by German philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein for the 'Symphony in Acid' video right from the start. Wittgensteins subjects and conclusions serve as excellent extenders to the fundamentals of the 'Unspoken Words' album. Especially in 'Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus' (1921), he explores in depth the concept of limits of language. Wittgenstein investigates various aspects of language, from the atomic point of view (form) to the wide picture (content). The thinker famously stated: 'The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.' With this video, I tried to challenge that notion in the field of visual art.

I build most of my works with code. In this case, I had to choose a coding environment suitable for rendering typography, an element central to this project. Running code as a website, through a modern internet browser, turned out to be the perfect solution. Personally, I find the gap between hypertext and 100-year-old paper both significant and inspiring. With my former experience in commercial web development, it was fun and refreshing to use my tools from back then for this new approach.

His work is rooted in fundamental elements of existence, which evolve into complex and immersive realms. Spencer uses interactive simulations to create projection artworks that are simple and aesthetically pleasing, but also raise big philosophical questions.

 

In his latest work, ""No Data,"" he explores the impact of changing abstract forms and their connection to music, using algorithmic chaos and improvisation to control millions of particles. The resulting forms emergently mimic aspects of organic life, revealing the common roots between the simulation and real life.

leftDoubleImage,Harold Cohen,"1928-2016, Computer Artist, UK","Harold Cohen (1928 – 2016) explored AI and art for nearly 50 years before we saw the rising popularity of these new machine learning tools. In those five decades, Cohen worked on a single program called Aaron that involved teaching a robot to create drawings. Aaron’s education took a similar path to that of humans, evolving from simple pictographic shapes and symbols to more figurative imagery, and finally into full-colour images. We had the great pleasure to include Cohen’s work from a series which had been done for an exhibition in 1983 at the Arnolfini in Bristol in our previous Automat und Mensch show.  

Harold Cohen was  a painter, printmaker and designer of textiles, but he is perhaps best known as the creator of AARON, as mentioned above, a computer program which uses artificial intelligence (the branch of computer science concerned with making computers behave like humans) to generate artworks. 

Harold Cohen was of great inspiration to many contemporary AI artists such as Tom White; White’s artwork investigates the Algorithmic Gaze: how machines see, know, and articulate the world. As machine perception becomes more pervasive in our daily lives, the world as seen by computers becomes our dominant reality. White explores this phenomenon in his work.

Collaborating with AI systems, White creates physical abstract prints that are reliably classified by neural networks. It’s art by AI, for AI. By giving the algorithms a voice to speak in, we are better able to see the world through the eyes of a machine.

Working across installation, performance, photography, sculpture and video, her multi-faceted projects explore the systems and structures through which we construct our reality, challenging us to rethink our presence within it.

Gleave was awarded a M.F.A. (Research) from the College of Fine Arts, University of New South Wales in 2007. She was commissioned to create Cloud Spa (Faux Mo), a pool of real cloud, installed underground as part of the Museum of Old and New Art’s (MONA) Festival of Music and Art (2016). That same year, she will also perform A Galaxy of Suns, where constellations will be transcribed into scores by her and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra as part of MONA’s Winter Arts Festival. A major museum exhibition of experimental media, Experimenta: Recharge – 8th International Biennial of Media Art, featuring Gleave’s series Model For The End Of The Universe, is currently touring across Australia (through 23 September 2016).

In 2015, Lines of Sight, in collaboration with Cameron Robbins, marked her fourth solo exhibition at Anna Pappas Gallery. Gleave has held solo exhibitions at the Fremantle Arts Centre, Western Australia (2013), Performance Space, Sydney (2012); Art Futures, Hong Kong Art Fair (2012) and group shows at Gertrude Contemporary, Melbourne (2011), the Kunstquartier Bethanien, Berlin (2010) and Primavera 09 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (2009). From 2012 to 2013, Gleave was the resident artist at the CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science Division. In 2015, she was the recipient of Australia’s foremost prize for emerging artists – The Churchie National Emerging Art Prize – and in 2012 she was awarded a Creative Australia Fellowship from the Australia Council for the Arts and a Marten Bequest Travelling Scholarship in 2009.

leftDoubleImage,"Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie
Posavec","Information Designers, USA","As we remain distanced, with a pandemic raging and craving physical connections, it is hard to tell one day from the next, let alone understand what we’re feeling and seeing. Let’s take a cue from this week’s Artist Project: collecting and drawing data can be a powerful tool to center ourselves, deal with daily anxiety, and practice empathy and gratitude.

In 2014, after meeting at a conference in Minneapolis, and feeling the beginning of a great friendship, information designers Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec decided to get to know each other via their favorite language: data. Each week for one year, Lupi and Posavec gathered information focusing on aspects of their lives—from the books in their homes and their to-do lists, to the complaints they’d voiced during the past seven days and the smells they’d encountered. They each rendered the data they had gathered that week in a visualization hand-drawn on a postcard that would travel all the way to the other side of the Atlantic—Lupi sending from New York and Posavec from London. On the front of the postcard there would be a representation of the data, and on the other, a detailed explanation of how to read the visualization: the legend or code needed to understand the drawing. The resulting 104 postcards are the record of a budding, now rock-solid friendship. They are also a surprising window onto the field of data visualization—normally considered impersonal, functional, and exquisitely digital, and here instead rendered emotionally expressive, gestural, and intimate. Giorgia Lupi explained this take on information design in her 2017 manifesto “Data Humanism.” In 2016, MoMA’s Department of Architecture and Design acquired this project, now titled Dear Data (2015).

left,Luciferins,"Interactive Installation, 2023","Luciferins—inspired by bioluminescent fish and the plethora of invisible network traffic that surrounds us—is an interactive environment of hanging fiber structures, filling a 15 x 15 foot space. The patterns used to create the felted wool structures were generated using code and Voronoi algorithms. Depth cameras are used to sense viewers and their movement in the space. Many fiber structures are distributed throughout the space, creating a layered environment that envelops the viewer’s body. As viewers move through the environment, the fiber structures closest to them illuminate with colorful graphical animations; field recordings from diverse locations play in the speakers. After a short period of time in one location, a graphical portal opens to show real time network communication packets, which are also invisibly traversing the space simultaneously. Radio transmissions then play in a 7-channel sound system. The portal opens only for a few seconds before returning the room to its normal state. Viewer movements illustrate parallel worlds just beyond our bodily perception.
Luciferins makes our digital networks perceptible when they are often imperceptible. The infrastructure that facilitates communication largely remains hidden. Luciferins’ network becomes perceptible by movement of the body. It gives viewers a sense of the invisible activity that surrounds them—just as a swimmer would make a dwelling of sea sparkle appear by swimming through it. Luciferins seeks to not only be an experience, but to open up the conversation about network control and privacy in the information age.",https://www.creativeapplications.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/LadyKStudios_Luciferins_Portal_1000h.jpg,,"Luciferins, Unnatural Processes, 2023",,https://www.creativeapplications.net/maxmsp/luciferins-an-interactive-installation-inspired-by-invisible-networks-of-bioluminescent-fish-and-internet-network-traffic/,"Installation, Sensory, Interactive",
leftDoubleImage,Ryoji Ikeda,"Visual Artist, Japan","The art of Japanese composer and artist Ryoji Ikeda (1966) consists of precise soundscapes and moving image. The artist approaches his materials in the manner of a composer. Whether a pixel, sound wave, space or data, Ikeda sees them all as part of the composition process. Ryoji Ikeda’s artistic practice saw its beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, when he worked as a DJ, sound technician and composer. In the early 2000s, Ikeda expanded his artistic expression to include visual art.

Born in Gifu in Japan, Ikeda currently works between Paris and Kyoto. Ryoji Ikeda’s works have been seen and heard in museums and events around the world. Ikeda has previously performed in Finland, but the current show at Amos Rex marks his first solo exhibition here. Ikeda’s art is characterized by a research-oriented approach, which was present already in his very first compositions. While Ikeda interprets scientific methods of categorizing data, he sets it to audiovisual rhythms and dramatic arcs, often consisting of extremes and opposites that blend with close to mathematical precision.

The art of Ikeda is also influenced by significant advances in scientific research. He has collaborated with different professionals in the fields of physics and mathematics.

Part of the works on display at Amos Rex are based on data from the massive archives of NASA, Human Genome Project and CERN, among others. Ikeda creates hypnotic spaces that put the viewer’s vision and hearing to the test. He is not interested in directing the experience of the viewer, but instead encourages us to approach his art with respect to our own standpoint. The museum visitor can engage with the works as analytical information networks or immerse themselves into the artist’s expanding space-sound continuum purely through sensory experiences that vibrate through the body.

The artist studied Digital Media Production at the University of the Arts in London, he holds a Master’s Degree in Digital Arts from Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, and he worked as a professor with a focus on interactive design, generative design, augmented and virtual reality environments at the CODE university in Berlin. MAOTIK best known for using computer-generated algorithms to create reality-shifting environments, he performs with his own audiovisual tools by generating graphic elements in real-time, in order to transform the perceptions of space. In constant collaboration with artists from other disciplines such as music, dance, theater, and architecture, but also with scientists, he investigates the relation between arts and technology, exploring new artistic languages.
INNER LIFE is an interactive installation that reacts to the movement of the public. By using a laser touch interactivity the public generates abstract visual composition that represent a mix of watercolor paintings and nature behaviors provoking a sound composition that changes according to the user action. Built as a parametric sound and visual architecture approach, the installation is presented as a system with a high process of random creation. In this sense, each interaction is unique and inimitable.

The public communicates directly to the digital world creating lights and abstract visuals. This explores human movement practice to facilitate movement expression and communication, and to design and develop new paradigms for interacting with computers through movement. FLOW is an immersive interactive installation that was adaptesd to the Eternal Space in Tokyo. Inspired by the natural phenomenon of the tides, the multimedia environment offers a sensory experience poetic, playful and aesthetic principles of the rise and fall of sea levels. It invites visitors to plunge into the fascinating world of science through interactive immersion.

The multimedia space aims to create an intelligent data environment where various forms of information can be expressed in a dynamic representation and enhance the perception of the physical space. Synchronised with the moon, the sea levels would change gradually and will create an environment that offers various degrees of immersion. The project will try to envelop the audience in a virtual universe abstract enough to allow daydreaming and free interpretation.

All the content is designed and run at realtime. The installation is an ""open form"" that offers various combination options to the interpreter. The idea is to create a system with a random creation process, in a range of settings defined by nature. In this sense, every state, the time of installation is unique and inimitable. Sound design will translate the visual landscape into a sonic experience that will dive the public at the center of a natural phenomenon. Extracted from: http://www.maotik.com/floweternal/

NONOTAK works with light and sound installations as well as performance pieces to create ethereal, immersive and dreamlike environments which are built to envelope, challenge and stagger the viewer.

NONOTAK capitalizes on Nakamoto’s approach to space, light and sound, and Schipfer’s experience with kinetic, visual and complex geometric illustrations. This results in a duo that creates pieces that put together light, sound and space in order to provide audiences with a uniquely visual and sensory experience.

The large range of projects NONOTAK is able to design and produce has allowed the duo to experiment in many different fields of art: architecture, music, fine arts, digital arts, scenography, theater, cinema, dance, design and fashion.

The studio has never expanded since its founding and still operates as a duo. Sound and visual content are all produced in-house, including their documentative contents that are available online as a visual preview of their work. NONOTAK’s aesthetic is inspired by minimal architecture and optical art.

NONOTAK have been touring their art pieces and have performed audiovisual shows all around the world several times: Europe, North and South America, Asia and Oceania.

leftDoubleImage,Talia Cotton,"Designer and Coder, USA","In Talia Cotton’s time at Pentagram, she lead on data-driven and algorithmic brand identities and websites, with a number of her projects hinged on pushing what was possible with design through coding. With access to such impactful projects, starting a new company “was never an option”, says the designer. Yet, at the same time, Talia was witnessing how coding was received in the industry. It's received with curiosity because of its “potential impact”, but frustration too, with many not knowing “how to get there or even what’s possible”. Cotton is Talia’s answer to this issue: a new agency situated at the intersection between design and code. Talia hopes the company will work to close the gap between the two mediums at a few points. Firstly, the company will serve as a home for designers who love to code, in a time when “more and more designers are graduating with the basic knowledge – and passion – for how to code”. Secondly, Talia wants Cotton to be a collaborator for agencies who aren’t currently working with the medium, or at its fullest potential.

Talia says there is a catch-22 in the design industry’s uptake of technology like coding. Despite the increase in those with coding skills and the uptick in digital-first companies, agencies have been slower to embrace it. Talia explains why this might be: “Firstly and most importantly, their code-less processes work and have worked for decades. (And if it ain’t broke..!). But secondly, for those agencies and design leads who have that curiosity for the exciting potentials of coding, many design leaders simply don’t have the background to understand how to guide those projects; it’s a skill that takes years of exposure to become an expert at.” Extracted from: https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/cotton-design-graphic-design-160223s",https://taliacotton.com/assets/img/og-image-2023b.png,"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6a17d7_4dc701db16d34c4b969176080fd9cc67~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_980,h_513,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/6a17d7_4dc701db16d34c4b969176080fd9cc67~mv2.png","Talia Cotton's Website, 2024","Talia Cotton's Website, 2023",https://taliacotton.com/2023/,"Code, Artist, Programming, Branding",
